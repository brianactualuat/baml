- AssistantResponseFeedback manages feedback buttons and sends feedback to the backend

The backend code is in ../sage-backend, in the /api/ask-baml/ routes.

The RPC interface with the backend is defined in ../../packages/sage-interface.

## Architecture Decision Records

### ADR 1: Implement Structured Logging for External Client Interactions

1. Implement structured logging at all external client boundaries across language implementations. Each language client (Go, Rust, TypeScript) will include logging infrastructure that captures key events, errors, and operational metrics when external systems interact with BAML. This logging follows a consistent pattern regardless of implementation language, ensuring uniform observability across the polyglot codebase. The logging captures client initialization, request/response cycles, error conditions, and performance metrics at the boundaries where external code interfaces with BAML internals.
